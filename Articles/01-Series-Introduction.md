# Introducing the Series - A proactive approach to Cloud Security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

In today’s modern IT landscape, Security shouldn’t be treated as a separate concern — it needs to be part of everyone’s mindset, from IT professionals to business stakeholders. Whenever a new initiative kicks off in your organization, Security should be built in from the very beginning.
That’s where **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** comes in. It’s Microsoft’s native solution for securing cloud environments across Azure, AWS, and GCP, helping you stay both proactive (through security recommendations) and reactive (via actionable alerts). But **Defender for Cloud** goes far beyond just alerts — it’s a powerful platform packed with features to help you monitor, protect, and improve your Cloud Security Posture.
In this series, we’ll explore those capabilities — so you can get the most out of **Defender for Cloud** and build a cloud environment that’s truly **secure by design**.
